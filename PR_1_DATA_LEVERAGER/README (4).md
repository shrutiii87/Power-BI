## 📁 Data Sources

| Source | Details |
|---|---|
| 📂 Folder Source | `Sales_Jan.xlsx`, `Sales_Feb.xlsx`, `Sales_Mar.xlsx` — loaded via Append Queries from Folder |
| 📄 Excel File | `Employees.xlsx` — EmployeeID, Name, Department, Region, BirthDate, Joining Date |
| 🌐 Web Table | Worldometers HTML table loaded using the Web Connector |

---

## 🧩 Transformation Tasks Breakdown

### 🔹 Task 1 — Data Extraction
- Loaded 3 monthly sales files using **Folder Source → Append Queries from Folder**
- Loaded `Employees.xlsx` as a separate Excel connection
- Loaded an HTML table from Worldometers using the **Web Connector**

---

### 🔹 Task 2 — Basic Transformations
- Removed blank rows and columns from sales data
- Promoted first row to headers
- Renamed columns — `Product` → `Product Name`, `JoinDate` → `Joining Date`
- Changed data types of `Revenue` and `Cost` using **Change Type with Locale**
- Removed duplicate rows

---

### 🔹 Task 3 — Text Tools

Applied on `CustomerName`, `City`, `Revenue`, `Region` in sales data:

| Function | Column Applied |
|---|---|
| `UPPER()` | CustomerName |
| `LOWER()` | City |
| `TRIM()` | Region, CustomerName |
| `REPLACE()` | Revenue |
| Split Column by Delimiter | CustomerName → `.1` & `.2` |

---

### 🔹 Task 4 — Numeric Tools
- Rounded `Revenue` column to **2 decimal places**
- Created custom column: `Profit = Revenue - Cost`

---

### 🔹 Task 5 — Date & Time Tools
- Extracted **Day, Month, Year, Quarter** from `Order Date`
- Created **Fiscal Month** column via Add Column → Date → Month
- Added calculated **Age** column from `BirthDate` in employees table

---

### 🔹 Task 6 — Conditional Columns & Indexing

| Condition | Category |
|---|---|
| Revenue >= 10,000 | 🟢 High |
| Revenue >= 5,000 | 🟡 Medium |
| Otherwise | 🔴 Low |

- Added **Index Column from 0** (0-based)
- Added **Index Column from 1** (1-based)

---

### 🔹 Task 7 — Pivot & Unpivot
- **Pivot:** Region column → Values: Revenue (Region rows → columns)
- **Unpivot:** Unpivoted columns back to normalized form

---

### 🔹 Task 8 — Merging & Appending
- **Append:** Jan + Feb + Mar already combined via Folder Source ✅
- **Merge:** Fuzzy Nested Join on `Region` column

---

### 🔹 Task 9 — Grouping & Aggregation

Grouped by `Source.Name` (month/file):

| File | Total Sales | Avg Order Value | Transaction Count |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sales_Jan.xlsx | ₹9,24,878.91 | ₹23,714.84 | 39 |
| Sales_Feb.xlsx | ₹9,37,628.91 | ₹24,041.76 | 39 |
| Sales_Mar.xlsx | ₹9,62,280.00 | ₹24,057.00 | 40 |

---

### 🔹 Task 10 — Data Profiling & Quality

Enabled **Column Quality**, **Column Distribution**, **Column Profile** from the View tab.

| Column | Distinct Values | Valid | Errors | Empty |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CustomerName | 85 | 100% | 0% | 0% |
| Region | 5 | 100% | 0% | 0% |
| Product | 8 | 100% | 0% | 0% |

---

### 🔹 Task 11 — Source Settings & Parameters
- Created **Parameter `FolderPath`** (Type: Text) with current folder path as default
- Used parameter to make folder source **dynamic**
- Changed data source credentials for `Employees.xlsx` via **Data Source Settings** ✅

---

### 🔹 Task 12 — Refresh Simulation
- Copied an existing file → renamed `Sales_Apr.xlsx` → placed in same folder
- Clicked **Refresh** in Power BI → April data loaded automatically ✅
- All previous transformations carried over successfully ✅

---

|---|---|
| Web connector not loading table | Used a stable Worldometers URL and selected the correct table from Navigator |
| Change Type with Locale errors | Selected **English (India)** as locale for Revenue and Cost columns |
| Data Source Settings path error after moving files | Re-entered correct path in Data Source Settings and refreshed |

## 📌 Key Insights Derived

- ✔️ **March had the highest total sales** at ₹9,65,290 across 40 transactions
- ✔️ All 3 months had **nearly equal average order values** (~₹24,000)
- ✔️ **Fuzzy join** successfully matched Region values despite case/space inconsistencies
- ✔️ Data profiling confirmed **100% data quality** — no errors, nulls, or duplicates
- ✔️ **Dynamic parameter setup** makes the pipeline reusable across any folder path
- ✔️ **Refresh simulation** proved the ETL pipeline is fully automated for new monthly data
