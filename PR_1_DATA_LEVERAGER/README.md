# 📊 Data Leverager – Power Query Transformation Project

An end-to-end ETL simulation project built using Power BI's Power Query Editor to extract, clean, reshape, and combine data from multiple sources using essential data engineering techniques.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project presents a complete Power Query ETL Pipeline built inside Microsoft Power BI Desktop. It demonstrates real-world data engineering skills including:

- 📂 **Multi-Source Extraction** — Sales files (Jan, Feb, Mar) loaded via Folder Source + Append
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning** — Removed blanks, duplicates, renamed columns, fixed data types
- 🔤 **Text Transformations** — UPPER, LOWER, TRIM, REPLACE, Split Column
- 🔢 **Numeric Transformations** — Rounding, Custom Profit Column
- 📅 **Date & Time Tools** — Day, Month, Year, Quarter, Fiscal Month, Age
- 🔀 **Pivot & Unpivot** — Region-wise reshaping of sales data
- 🔗 **Merge & Append** — Fuzzy Nested Join of employees + sales on Region
- 📊 **Group By & Aggregation** — Total Sales, Avg Order Value, Transaction Count
- 🔍 **Data Profiling** — Column Quality, Distribution, and Profile views
- ⚙️ **Dynamic Parameters** — FolderPath parameter for dynamic data source
- 🔄 **Refresh Simulation** — Auto-loaded April data via folder source

## 📁 Data Sources

| Source | Details |
|--------|---------|
| 📂 Folder Source | Sales_Jan.xlsx, Sales_Feb.xlsx, Sales_Mar.xlsx — loaded via Append Queries from Folder |
| 📄 Excel File | Employees.xlsx — EmployeeID, Name, Department, Region, BirthDate, Joining Date |
| 🌐 Web Table | Wikipedia HTML table loaded using the Web Connector |

## 🧩 Transformation Tasks Breakdown

| NOTE:- after openeing the file . refersh the sales data then it will work . |

### 🔹 1️⃣ Data Extraction (Task 1)
- Loaded 3 monthly sales files using Folder Source → Append Queries from Folder
- Loaded Employees.xlsx as a separate Excel connection
- Loaded an HTML table from Wikipedia using the Web connector

### 🔹 2️⃣ Basic Transformations (Task 2)
- Removed blank rows and columns from sales data
- Promoted first row to headers
- Renamed columns — `Product` → `Product Name`, `JoinDate` → `Joining Date`
- Changed data types of Revenue and Cost using Change Type with Locale
- Removed duplicate rows

### 🔹 3️⃣ Text Tools (Task 3)

Applied on `CustomerName`, `Product Name`, and `Region` in sales data:

| Function | Column Applied |
|----------|---------------|
| UPPER() | CustomerName |
| LOWER() | Product Name |
| TRIM() | Region |
| REPLACE() | Revenue |
| Split Column by Delimiter | CustomerName → .1 & .2 |

### 🔹 4️⃣ Numeric Tools (Task 4)
- Rounded Revenue column to 2 decimal places
- Created custom column: `Profit = Revenue - Cost`

### 🔹 5️⃣ Date & Time Tools (Task 5)
- Extracted Day, Month, Year, Quarter from Order Date
- Created Fiscal Month column via Add Column → Date → Month
- Added calculated Age column from BirthDate in employees table

### 🔹 6️⃣ Conditional Columns & Indexing (Task 6)

| Condition | Category |
|-----------|----------|
| Revenue >= 10,000 | 🟢 High |
| Revenue >= 5,000 | 🟡 Medium |
| Otherwise | 🔴 Low |

- Added Index Column from 0 (0-based)
- Added Index Column from 1 (1-based)

### 🔹 7️⃣ Pivot & Unpivot (Task 7)
- **Pivot:** Region column → Values: Revenue (Region rows → columns)
- **Unpivot:** Unpivoted columns back to normalized form

### 🔹 8️⃣ Merging & Appending (Task 8)
- **Append:** Jan + Feb + Mar already combined via Folder Source ✅
- **Merge:** Fuzzy Nested Join on Region column

### 🔹 9️⃣ Grouping & Aggregation (Task 9)

Grouped by `Source.Name` (month/file):

| File | Total Sales | Avg Order Value | Transaction Count |
|------|------------|----------------|------------------|
| Sales_Jan.xlsx | 9,24,878.91 | 23,714.84 | 39 |
| Sales_Feb.xlsx | 9,37,628.91 | 24,041.76 | 39 |
| Sales_Mar.xlsx | 9,62,280.00 | 24,057.00 | 40 |

### 🔹 🔟 Data Profiling & Quality (Task 10)
- Enabled Column Quality, Column Distribution, Column Profile from View tab

| Column | Distinct Values | Valid | Errors | Empty |
|--------|----------------|-------|--------|-------|
| CustomerName | 114 | 100% | 0% | 0% |
| Region | 4 | 100% | 0% | 0% |
| Product | 5 | 100% | 0% | 0% |

### 🔹 1️⃣1️⃣ Source Settings & Parameters (Task 11)
- Created Parameter `FolderPath` (Type: Text) with current folder path as default
- Used parameter to make folder source dynamic
- Changed data source credentials for Employees.xlsx via Data Source Settings ✅

### 🔹 1️⃣2️⃣ Refresh Simulation (Task 12)
- Copied an existing file → renamed `Sales_Apr.xlsx` → placed in same folder
- Clicked Refresh in Power BI → April data loaded automatically ✅
- All previous transformations carried over successfully ✅

## 📌 Key Insights Derived

✔️ March had the highest total sales at ₹9,62,280 across 40 transactions

✔️ All 3 months had nearly equal average order values (~₹24,000)

✔️ Fuzzy join successfully matched Region values despite case/space inconsistencies

✔️ Data profiling confirmed 100% data quality — no errors, nulls, or duplicates

✔️ Dynamic parameter setup makes the pipeline reusable across any folder path

✔️ Refresh simulation proved the ETL pipeline is fully automated for new monthly data
